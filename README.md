# Implementation of Logistic Regression Model for Classifying Food Choices for Diabetic Patients

## AIM:
To implement a logistic regression model to classify food items for diabetic patients based on nutrition information.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
```
Load the food items dataset.

Separate input features (nutrition values) and target label.

Normalize the input features using MinMaxScaler.

Encode the target variable using LabelEncoder.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the Logistic Regression model on training data.

Predict the class labels for test data.

Evaluate the model using accuracy and other performance metrics.

# Load the dataset

X_raw = df.iloc[:, :-1]

scaler= MinMaxScaler()

# Scaling the raw input features

X = scaler.fit_transform(X_raw)

#Create a LabelEncoder object

label_encoder = LabelEncoder()

#Encode the target variable

y = label_encoder.fit_transform(y_raw.values.ravel())

#Note that ravel() function flattens the vector.

#First, let's split the training and testing dataset

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=y, random_state = 123)
# L2 penalty to shrink coefficients without removing any features from the model
penalty = 'l2'

# Our classification problem is multinomial
multi_class = 'multinomial'

# Use lbfgs for L2 penalty and multinomial classes
solver = 'lbfgs'

# Max iteration = 1000
max_iter = 1000

# Define a logistic regression model with above arguments
l2_model = LogisticRegression(random_state=123, penalty=penalty, multi_class=multi_class, solver=solver, max_iter=max_iter)

l2_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
